In total, the entire project took me about ~30 hours to complete, the first 10 of which were spent learning the ins/outs of editing in Adobe Premiere.</p>\n\n          <div\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\"\n            style=\"padding-bottom: 56.258790436005626%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\n          >\n            <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqQYfoxpLEE\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"\n            position: absolute;\n            top: 0;\n            left: 0;\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 100%;\n          \"></iframe>\n          </div>\n          \n<p>I’ve always had a secret interest in film composition and going to Las Vegas to celebrate my friend’s birthday gave me an opportunity to explore it. Looking back, I wasn’t satisfied with how this video turned out. From the footage that I had shot to the specific cuts that I used, I think there was a lot of room for improvement and I certainly made a lot of mistakes putting it together.</p>\n<h3>Unplanned Shots</h3>\n<p>To be fair, I sort of went into this kind of blind. I didn’t have a specific goal or end product in mind, just that I wanted to create a video reflecting my time in Las Vegas. Because of this and the fact that I was shooting everything handheld, 90% of the footage I ended up with became unusable. Here were some of the problems I came across during my edit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Shaky Footage -</b> Because my camera was attached to a handheld grip combined with a lack of focus, most of my footage ended up really shaky. It felt like I was in mid-seizure during every shot. Even with electronic stabilization in post, the video still looked really blurry and distorted.\n<br /><br /></li>\n<li><b>Lighting -</b> I never ended up taking into account the lighting of each area I was filming in and because of this some of my footage became overexposed while others suffered from noise/graininess due to low light.\n<br /><br /></li>\n<li><b>Useless Shots -</b> I never planned any of my shots from the get-go and just filmed what I thought was interesting at the time. This ended up hurting me during the edit as I hadn’t captured any of the important moments I wanted to and the ones that did make it in had bad angles and made for rough transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honestly, most of the trouble I ran into could’ve been fixed if I had just planned my shots! Planning in advance would’ve allowed me to think about the moments I wanted to highlight, the lighting and angles of every shot, and with a steady hand (or a gimbal), it would’ve made for a less frustrating edit. Having a clear vision going in was definitely the biggest takeaway from this experience.</p>\n<h3>Transitions and Colors</h3>\n<p>Despite all the hiccups in post, there were definitely certain aspects of the edit that I think I did well in (for a first attempt anyway). On top of that list would be custom transitions.</p>\n<p>Piecing together the footage in my timeline, I was initially transitioning from one scene to the next with a simple cut. Although effective, it quickly became jarring to watch, especially with scenes cutting from standstill shots to ones with motion. Custom transitions like zooms, wipes, and blurs helped alleviate this problem by adding motion in between the cuts making them appear more seamless and also gave a stylistic flair to the edit. It also additionally helped detract from the inherent shakiness in the footage.</p>\n<p>Color grading was another aspect of the final cut I think I managed to do a decent job in. I initially had shot everything in a flat color profile because I had wanted the flexibility to adjust the style of the video in post, but had no sense of direction on the aesthetic I was aiming for. I ended up defaulting to the classic orange and teal look that many Hollywood movies mimic today as a baseline for my color grade. Here is an example of the changes the footage went through as I was color correcting and then color grading the flat image:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 540px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 177.77777777777777%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Color Grade\"\n        title=\"Color Grade\"\n        src=\"/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/26e3b/colorgrade.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/ccfaa/colorgrade.jpg 240w,\n/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/d3729/colorgrade.jpg 480w,\n/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/26e3b/colorgrade.jpg 540w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>This ended up working out pretty well and although I didn’t strictly adhere to the baseline profile in other shots, the overall look managed to match the aesthetic I had in mind.</p>\n<p>Editing this video was definitely a long and arduous process, but I learned a lot from the experience that I could apply to videos I make going forward!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Final Cut\"\n        title=\"Final Cut\"\n        src=\"/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/f0d68/finalcut.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/ccfaa/finalcut.jpg 240w,\n/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/d3729/finalcut.jpg 480w,\n/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/f0d68/finalcut.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>"},"prevPost":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Food in Jaipur","asset_folder":3},"fields":{"year":"2018"},"html":"<p>I went to India last month for a relatively short trip to visit my extended family living in Jaipur. It had been about 4 years since my last visit and although most of the city felt the same, Jaipur had gone through some major economic growth and urban development. There were a lot more things to do, places to visit, and restaurants were exploding in popularity; which brings me to my rant: most restaurants sucked.</p>\n<p>My family and I had eaten at a different restaurant most nights we were there. We really didn’t want my grandma cooking dinner for 5 and it was usually very cheap (~$3 a meal). Living in a crowded city, we were presented with thousands of dining options. Because of this, a lot of restaurants would often try to stand out by offering a ton of variety. It wasn’t uncommon for us to get seated and look at a menu with 50+ items which presents itself to an old saying. Jack of all trades, master of none.</p>\n<p>I've lately grown to be more skeptical of restaurants that offer large menu selections mostly because a kitchen staff can only consistently perfect a few dishes. Large menus would mean a variety of different orders and a likely decline in the overall quality of each dish. This problem was further compounded by the fact that most restaurants I ate at would often offer Mexican, Italian, and Chinese alongside Indian cuisine which meant a lot more variety in styles of cooking. Don’t get me wrong, the Indian food was amazing! It was everything else that was bad. The worst part of it all was that I felt that most patrons couldn't tell the difference.</p>\n<p>Growing up in New York, I always felt like I had a good sense of what certain foods should and shouldn’t taste like. Living in a melting pot that is as big as NYC is, every culture is pretty equally represented in the restaurant scene. It wasn't just that the food in Jaipur was bad, it was that local patrons had nothing to compare it to. The worst offender was probably this extremely sweet enchilada I had. Almost like a candy bar. Enchiladas aren't supposed to be that sweet. Next time I visit, I'll probably just stick to Indian.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that’s my short rant on the food in Jaipur.
