Team Fortress 2 was an online multiplayer first-person shooter with a massive in-game economy and tons of custom modded game servers.</p>\n<p>While initially started as a side project to create a place for a few of tightknit friends and I to play games together grew into a community with a massive player base and a cult-like following. RA began operation in March of 2012 hosting a single 16 player game server. By 2013, we had grown to accomodate 3 servers hosting 32 players each.</p>\n<p>By 2014, RA had reached its peak, growing to 5 dedicated game servers along the East Coast with an active base of 200+ players. We maintained 1500 unique visitors a month, a dedicated forum system, and about 10 on staff community members monitoring our services. </p>\n<p>Unfortunatly, due to the amount of personal workload and decline in community support from Valve, Rated Awesome unofficially ceased operations in June of 2015. We reopened in March of 2017.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<p>For more information and resources, check out the links below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ratedawesome.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/2017/evolution-of-rated-awesome/\">Blog Post</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Blackglade/RatedAwesome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>License</h3>\n<p>Any open source software distrubuted by Rated Awesome is under the <a href=\"https://github.com/Blackglade/RatedAwesome/blob/master/LICENSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MIT License</a>.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"url":"/projects/ratedawesome/"}}}
