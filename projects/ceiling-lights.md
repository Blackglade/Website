### Background
Moving into an apartment in Maryland, I found myself living with less than adequate lighting in my bedroom. In the daytime it was fine as the windows let in plenty of natural sunlight, but at night, it became pretty gloomy. So, having a prior interest in learning woodworking, I decided to build my own lamp. 

You can check out my written up blog post [here](/blog/2017/diy-ceiling-lights/) detailing the process. Below is a timelapse video I made of the whole project.
