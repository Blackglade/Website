The problem is… there is none.</p>\n<h3>Retr0bright</h3>\n<p>The next step in the process was to Retr0bright the casing. <a href=\"https://www.retr0bright.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Retr0bright</a>-ing, if you haven’t heard, was a process developed in 2008 by a bunch of chemists, engineers, and retro hackers to turn the <a href=\"https://www.retr0bright.com/after_eight_hours.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">yellow-ing/brown-ing of old computer hardware</a> that would often occur over time back to its original color (usually white). You can read more about it <a href=\"https://www.retr0bright.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, but the short version is that a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and an activating agent smeared on the casing combined with UV light for a few hours will actually reverse the aging process.</p>\n<p>So that was the plan. I had all the materials ready to start Retr0bright-ing the Macintosh Plus when I came across this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZYbchvSUDY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">video</a>. The author conducted some experiments with different methods of whitening ABS Plastic (which is what most retrotech is made out of) and discovered that applying heat (around 160°F) to a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would actually give better results than traditional Retr0bright-ing methods and in a shorter amount of time. So I went about designing an experiment...</p>\n<h3>Experiments &#x26; Mistakes</h3>\n<p>I bought some Salon Creme Developer online to serve as the hydrogen peroxide + activating agent mixture and poured it into a large plastic tub filled with water. The case was then submerged into the Retr0bright bath and with the help of an immersion heater, heated to 160°F. I used an IR Thermometer to monitor the temperature.</p>\n<p>This is the part where I started running into a variety of problems and I’ll sort of list them here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For one, 160°F was NOT an ideal temperature to heat the mixture. ABS Plastic starts to become malleable around 155°F and it only rises with every degree. On my first trial run, the case became heavily deformed with entire sides concaved inward and melted in.</li>\n<li>Monitoring the temperature constantly was absolutely crucial to the process. Leaving the immersion heater on unmonitored for more than 5 minutes at a time would cause rapid rises in temperature sometimes peaking upwards of 190°F.</li>\n<li>Leaving the immersion heater on with the Macintosh Plus case inside the container often created issues. Since the heater was usually placed off to a single corner, the mixture in that corner would often be hotter than in the rest of the container. This temperature gradient transfered over to the case causing cracks/deformities on the side facing the heater.</li>\n<li>Putting any amount of pressure on the case over a long period time would cause minor bends even at lower temperatures (140°F/130°F).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I went through about 3 cases trying to get the Retr0bright to work correctly. Yup. That’s 3 Macintosh Plus’ I had to buy from Ebay, sell the internal components online, and then buy enough salon creme developer to Retr0bright them all. Although I ended up making most of my money back, destroying three Macintosh Plus cases wasn't my proudest moment. By the third one, however, the huge deformities that once occurred turned into barely noticeable imperfections. </p>\n<p>Here is a picture of my victims. May they rest in peace.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Destroyed Macintosh Plus\"\n        title=\"Destroyed Macintosh Plus\"\n        src=\"/static/c692ca7fe2b4bb6cc713c2c018e157c3/f0d68/plus_rip1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c692ca7fe2b4bb6cc713c2c018e157c3/ccfaa/plus_rip1.jpg 240w,\n/static/c692ca7fe2b4bb6cc713c2c018e157c3/d3729/plus_rip1.jpg 480w,\n/static/c692ca7fe2b4bb6cc713c2c018e157c3/f0d68/plus_rip1.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>I ended up learning a lot throughout this process (even though at the sacrifice of three Macintosh Plus’). For one, I managed to cut down the Retr0bright time from ~8 to just under 3 hours with no damage to the item. Here are the steps you could take to roughly achieve the same thing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Find a container (ideally plastic) slightly larger than the item you are about to Retr0bright and fill it up to the desired water level. This should either submerge the item completely or halfway.</span></li>\n<li><span>Once it is filled, turn on and submerge the immersion heater until you reach a water temperature of 180°F and then pour in the Retr0bright. Make sure to mix the contents of the container so that the Retr0bright is evenly diluted and the temperature is uniform. I roughly used about 1 liter of Retr0bright for every 10 Liters of water, but this can vary on a case by case basis.</span></li>\n<li><span>Wait for the temperature to reach 155F before submerging the item in.</span></li>\n<li><span>Cover the container to prevent heat from escaping. Wait 10 minutes or until the temperature drops to 140°F (whichever comes first) and then take the item out to cool.</span></li>\n<li><span>Lightly clean the case with a dry rag.</span></li>\n<li><span>Reheat the Retr0bright bath to 155°F and repeat steps 3 to 6 until a desired color is achieved.</span></li>\n<li><span>Finally, clean the case off thoroughly with water and dry.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following these steps will pretty much ensure a uniform color restoration in under 3 hours.</p>\n<p>Anyway, that’s pretty much my update on The Plus Project so far. Moving forward, I have no idea what’s going to happen. I would like to eventually buy another Macintosh Plus and restore it properly, but I’m not really sure when I’ll have the time and/or funds to do that in the future. So for now this is it. Thanks for reading!</p>"},"prevPost":{"frontmatter":{"title":"DIY Ceiling Lights","asset_folder":5},"fields":{"year":"2017"},"html":"<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>I moved back down to Maryland recently and found myself living in an apartment. Although it came fully furnished, there wasn't enough lighting in my bedroom except for a single dimly lit ceiling lamp in the center. In the daytime it was fine as the windows let in plenty of natural sunlight, but at night, it became pretty gloomy.</p>\n<p>Having a prior interest in woodworking and wanting to get more comfortable using power tools, I ended up designing and building my own lamp. Below is a detailed account/guide on how I went about the project. You can also check out the timelapse video I made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iglErh-sGJ4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Parts</h3>\n<p>An afternoon of scrolling through pictures of hanging lights gave me the inspiration for my initial design. I wanted to make a minimalist neutral toned ceiling lamp with pendant lights and splashes of color.</p>\n<p>For parts, I bought the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5' x 7.5\" x 3\" Poplar Board from Home Depot - $12</li>\n<li>½ Pint of Weathered Gray Wood Stain - $13</li>\n<li>Silicon Socket Pendant Lights - $30</li>\n<li>Steel Wire Suspension Cables - $10</li>\n<li>Adhesive Ceiling Hooks - $7</li>\n<li>LED Dimmable Globe Bulbs - $30</li>\n<li>12-Gauge Solid Black Wire - $11</li>\n<li>Plug-In Lamp Dimmer - $13</li>\n<li>12 Feet Extension Cord - $5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choosing the right type of wood took some initial research. I wanted to buy something that was strong, stained well, and had an interesting wood grain pattern. I initially considered using Cedar, but ended up going with Poplar instead. For power tools, I had access to a woodshop where I did most of the work.</p>\n<h3>The Process</h3>\n<p>Preparing the board was fairly straightforward. I measured the Poplar and sketched drill marks at the center and then 4 more each 1’ apart. This would create a total of 5 holes for me to thread the pendant lights through with 6” leftover at the ends.</p>\n<p>I also sketched drill marks at the corners of the board to make room for the suspension cable inserts. One of the main problems I had was finding a way to hang the board on my ceiling without drilling holes into the wall. I ended up finding these thin steel wire suspension cables online made for mounting lights that I could attach to strong adhesive hooks placed on the ceiling. This proved to be the most effective way to avoid any ceiling damage and loosing my security deposit.</p>\n<p>The suspension system had to be flush with the board and it took some preliminary testing on scrap wood to find how far in from the corner of the wood I would have to drill a hole without splitting the wood. I ended up drilling 4 holes 1.5” in from the corner of the wood for the suspension system.</p>\n<h3>The Finish</h3>\n<p>Researching how to properly finish wood took most of my time. I wanted an aged rustic gray finish similar to old barn wood which would bring more focus to the colorful lights hanging beneath it. To get this look, I had to artificially age the wood. I did this by running a wire brush drill bit through the wood going slowly with and against the grain to bring out some of the texture. It was then sanded down using 220 grit paper and painted.</p>\n<p>A single coat of oil-based weathered gray wood stain applied evenly on both sides worked perfectly. After drying, I used black and white acrylic paint diluted in water to accent the wood and create contrasting color textures. For the final finish, I ended up applying wax and buffing it to create a matte finish.</p>\n<h3>The Wiring</h3>\n<p>Wiring the board up was fairly straightforward. I inserted the lights in the drilled holes and hot glued them in place. I then connected the circuit in parallel by soldering each wire to separate positive and negative terminals and used an industrial stapler to keep all the wiring in place. </p>\n<p>Initially, I was a bit concerned about overheating due to the diameter of my wire and the amount of current that would be passing through so I ended up using 12-Gauge Wire for the main lines. After testing to make sure everything was working correctly, the entire circuit was wrapped in electrical tape for insulation and with the help of some friends, hung just above the futon in my room.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Overall, I am pretty happy with how these lights turned out. Albeit a little bit pricey, I was definitely satisfied with the final result and learned a lot about woodworking in the process. I also documented a lot of the steps and uploaded a short timelapse video you can check out below!
