### Background
[Rated Awesome](https://ratedawesome.com/) is a gaming community I first started after being introduced to the popular online video game [Team Fortress 2 (TF2)](https://www.teamfortress.com/). Team Fortress 2 was an online multiplayer first-person shooter with a massive in-game economy and tons of custom modded game servers.

While initially started as a side project to create a place for a few of tightknit friends and I to play games together grew into a community with a massive player base and a cult-like following. RA began operation in March of 2012 hosting a single 16 player game server. By 2013, we had grown to accomodate 3 servers hosting 32 players each.

By 2014, RA had reached its peak, growing to 5 dedicated game servers along the East Coast with an active base of 200+ players. We maintained 1500 unique visitors a month, a dedicated forum system, and about 10 on staff community members monitoring our services. 

Unfortunatly, due to the amount of personal workload and decline in community support from Valve, Rated Awesome unofficially ceased operations in June of 2015. We reopened in March of 2017.
