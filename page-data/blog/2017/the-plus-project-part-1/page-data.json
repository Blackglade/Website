I wanted to fix it up and get it working, but something always got in the way. It was actually given to me a couple years back at a Maker Faire in 2013. I had stumbled into this vintage electronics booth and the plus sitting there. Fixing it up sounded like a good idea at the time so I took it off the owner's hands. This was 5 years ago...</p>\n<p>Anyway, I've had a lot more time lately and decided to take it out of storage to work on. This will probably be a multi-part series. I can’t fit all my research into one post.</p>\n<h3>Inside the Computer</h3>\n<p>Apple first introduced the Macintosh Plus in January of 1986. Following their original Macintosh line, the Plus retailed at $2599 and was largely seen as an upgrade, shipping with 1MB of RAM, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SCSI (“scuzzy”) bus</a>, and other smaller improvements.</p>\n<p>Using an online decoder with my Macintosh Plus’s serial number <strong>F629063M0001A</strong>, I found out that this computer was the 207th unit manufactured on the 29th week of 1986 <em>(~August)</em> in Fremont, CA. That is almost 7 months after it first debuted!</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_outside2.jpg\" alt=\"Plus Outside\"></p>\n<p>Opening the case was a <strong>fucking</strong> hassle. For some reason, Apple <em>opted in</em> to use special Torx T15 screws instead of standard flatheads. Even then, most standard T15 screwdrivers didn't work because they had to be able access the deeply recessed screws in the case. It took a while to find the right screwdriver.</p>\n<p>With the case open and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube#Electric_shock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CRT monitor discharged</a>, the first thing I did was take a picture of Steve Jobs’ signature. According to this <a href=\"https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&#x26;story=Signing_Party.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a>, in the early days of Apple, Steve Jobs encouraged the design team to consider themselves as artists building the Macintosh. As with any artist, it was only appropriate for them to sign their work which eventually got engraved into the final plastic molding of the case.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_case2.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Jobs Signature\"></p>\n<p>Looking inside, the computer seemed mostly intact. Despite some rust/corrosion near the PRAM battery slot and dust, the Plus was in fairly good shape.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_inside1.jpg\" alt=\"Macintosh Plus Open\"></p>\n<p>From here, I decided to disassemble the entire unit so I could get rid the dust that had collected over the years. I read somewhere online that soaking the entire board in soapy water and then giving it time to properly dry worked well, and in some cases, even helped fix computer glitches. I ended up soaking the power supply, internal metal casing, and logic board (making sure to take out any removable IC's/wires). The floppy drive was cleaned using a can of compressed air and I ended up wiping down the CRT monitor and case with a wet towel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_together.jpg\" alt=\"Macintosh Plus Components\"></p>\n<h3>The Components</h3>\n<p>Feel free to skip over this section. This part is mostly for me to fanboy over some of the older chipsets. Some of the components are labeled in the picture.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n<h4>The Logic Board</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_logic.jpg\" alt=\"Logic Board\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>The Power Supply</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_psu.jpg\" alt=\"The Power Supply\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>CRT Monitor</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_crt.jpg\" alt=\"CRT Monitor\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>The Floppy Drive</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/3/plus_floppy.jpg\" alt=\"The Floppy Drive\"></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Decisions, Decisions</h3>\n<p>Moving forward, I essentially had 2 options. Restoring the Plus to its original condition <strong>OR</strong> upgrading it with new parts.</p>\n<p>Restoring it seemed like an obvious choice at first until I started calculating the cost of repair. Assuming all existing components worked properly, I was still looking at $200 in repair costs. This included buying a compatible keyboard and mouse, finding a working SCSI HD since the Plus had no permanent storage, and getting a copy of the original OS on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_format#Single_Sided.2C_Double_Density\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">double density floppy disk</a>. The Plus’s floppy drive reads only double density disks which are grossly outdated and obsolete. If an issue did come up, however, with the logic/power board, that price could would jump to $300+. In the end it just didn't make sense to spend all that money working on something that could only run a very dated version of Mac OS.</p>\n<p>So I arrived at my second choice; upgrading it with new parts. Looking around, I found <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-ApplePi-Merging-a-Vintage-Macintosh-Plus-Wi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">several</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@trm42/raspberry-pi-2-macintosh-plus-raspintosh-cd2f6691fecf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">projects</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q-zmSzjZ8w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">online</a> that had replaced the internals of the Plus with a Raspberry PI or other Single-Board Computer, but kept the original casing. This is the route I ended up taking.</p>"},"prevPost":{"id":"0a90a487-859a-570d-8014-27c321ad3c94","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of Rated Awesome","asset_folder":1},"fields":{"year":"2017"},"html":"<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://ratedawesome.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rated Awesome (RA)</a> is an online gaming community I started back in March of 2012. Obsessed with <a href=\"https://www.teamfortress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Team Fortress 2</a> at the time and it’s huge player base, RA was my attempt to get more involved with the community. What initially started as a side project to create a place for a few tightknit friends, grew into a massive player base across 4 different servers, 200+ players, and 1500 unique visitors a month. As with any big community, the rise in popularity and player growth came with its fair share of obstacles. This mostly involved general server maintenance and creating an online presence our players could associate with (branding, style, forums). In an attempt to keep costs low (instead of hiring help), I took it upon myself to tackle each of these obstacles and what came next were a series of erratic changes spanned out over the next couple of years. Below is the remnants of the evolution of Rated Awesome.</p>\n<h3>Evolving Logo</h3>\n<p>Over the course of several years, I was <strong>constantly</strong> changing the logo design.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>The First Logo (Mar 2012)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo1.png\" alt=\"Logo 1\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>My Design (Dec 2012)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo2.png\" alt=\"Logo 2\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Paid Job (Feb 2013)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo3.png\" alt=\"Logo 3\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Paid Job 2 (Nov 2013)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo4.png\" alt=\"Logo 4\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>New Artist (Jul 2014)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo5.png\" alt=\"Logo 5\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Current (Jan 2017)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo6.png\" alt=\"Logo 6\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Failed Designs</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo_other.jpg\" alt=\"Logo Other\"></p>\n</div>\n<h3>The Website</h3>\n<p>Learning to design a proper website with matching schemes and complimentary typography was rough at first.
