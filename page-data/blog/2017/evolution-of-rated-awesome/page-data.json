Obsessed with <a href=\"https://www.teamfortress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Team Fortress 2</a> at the time and itâ€™s huge player base, RA was my attempt to get more involved with the community. What initially started as a side project to create a place for a few tightknit friends, grew into a massive player base across 4 different servers, 200+ players, and 1500 unique visitors a month. As with any big community, the rise in popularity and player growth came with its fair share of obstacles. This mostly involved general server maintenance and creating an online presence our players could associate with (branding, style, forums). In an attempt to keep costs low (instead of hiring help), I took it upon myself to tackle each of these obstacles and what came next were a series of erratic changes spanned out over the next couple of years. Below is the remnants of the evolution of Rated Awesome.</p>\n<h3>Evolving Logo</h3>\n<p>Over the course of several years, I was <strong>constantly</strong> changing the logo design.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>The First Logo (Mar 2012)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo1.png\" alt=\"Logo 1\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>My Design (Dec 2012)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo2.png\" alt=\"Logo 2\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Paid Job (Feb 2013)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo3.png\" alt=\"Logo 3\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Paid Job 2 (Nov 2013)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo4.png\" alt=\"Logo 4\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>New Artist (Jul 2014)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo5.png\" alt=\"Logo 5\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Current (Jan 2017)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo6.png\" alt=\"Logo 6\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>Failed Designs</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/logo_other.jpg\" alt=\"Logo Other\"></p>\n</div>\n<h3>The Website</h3>\n<p>Learning to design a proper website with matching schemes and complimentary typography was rough at first. Our website went through <strong>A LOT</strong> of changes. Unfortunately, these are the only snapshots I could recover from <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The WayBack Machine</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h4>Evolving Forums (Mar 2013)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/website1.jpg\" alt=\"Logo Other\">\n<br /></p>\n<h4>The Shutdown (Jan 2014)</h4>\n<p><img src=\"assets/2/website2.jpg\" alt=\"Logo Other\"></p>\n</div>"},"prevPost":null},"pageContext":{"currPost":"/blog/2017/evolution-of-rated-awesome/","prevPost":""}}}
