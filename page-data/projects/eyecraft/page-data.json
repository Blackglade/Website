Over the course of my junior and senior year of high school, I worked at the lab as an intern shadowing Dr. Parra and one of his graduate students who was studying Human-Computer Interaction.</p>\n<p>At the end of my internship, I decided to conduct my own research exploring how gaming interfaces could be enhanced using eye tracking. To demonstrate my findings, I wrote a <a href=\"/5c9e387e4fe51fd2891f06acc6e5e6bd/paper.pdf\">research paper</a> on the topic and developed an implementation of some of the ideas I had using the <a href=\"https://theeyetribe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">EyeTribe Tracker</a> and the popular sandbox game, <a href=\"https://minecraft.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Minecraft</a>.</p>\n<h3>Recognition</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>New York Science &#x26; Engineering Fair (<a href=\"https://nycsef.cuny.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NYSCEF</a>) 2015 - <a href=\"/f0383e769ed7afc61c92e7676be1248d/award.pdf\">Computer Science 3 Place</a>   </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fox5ny.com/news/1445353-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Featured Fox5 News Interview</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"url":"/projects/eyecraft/"}}}
