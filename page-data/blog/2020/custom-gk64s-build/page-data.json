It only ever went up from there as browsing endless pictures and videos of custom keyboard builds made me want to make something more <em>special</em>. You can watch the full build montage here: </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.258790436005626%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bAM-kNomsZ0\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>There were a couple of requirements I had when it came to picking out the parts for my build:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The keyboard had to be 60%. My experience with both tenkeyless and 65% had given a huge preference for 60%. The compact size, but still enough ample room for other function keys was very appealing</li>\n<li>I needed dedicated arrow keys. None of this \"the shift and ctrl could function as pseudo arrow keys if you switch to a different layer\". I like to play video games. Some of those video games require arrow keys instead of WASD. I needed dedicated arrow keys.</li>\n<li>Had to be wireless. Love the idea of a compact wireless keyboard.</li>\n<li>Wanted a minimalistic look. I never found a printed keycap set I really liked. Blanks seemed like the way to go. Plus, I'm a pretty good touch typist.</li>\n<li>Had to have tactile switches. Linear just feels like membrane but in a different package and clicky can be too loud at times. Tactile is just the perfect amount of noise and Zealios was my top pick.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that, my search led to the <strong>GK64S PCB</strong>. The <strong>GK64</strong> was already a popular 60% keyboard layout with dedicated arrow keys. The <code class=\"language-text\">S</code> variant added bluetooth support. Here is the rest of my parts list along with associated price:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GK64S PCB -</strong> $57.24</li>\n<li><strong>Aluminum Case -</strong> $46.11</li>\n<li><strong>Aluminum Plate -</strong> $20.11</li>\n<li><strong>Durock Stabilizers -</strong> $14.04</li>\n<li><strong>Zealios v2 62g Switches -</strong> $82.11</li>\n<li><strong>JST Connector -</strong> $1.59</li>\n<li><strong>3500mAh LiPo Battery -</strong> $12.81</li>\n<li><strong>Magnetic Power Cable -</strong> $7.84</li>\n<li><strong>SA Blank Keycap Set -</strong> $90</li>\n<li><strong>Custom SA Color Keycaps -</strong> $10.78</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total: <strong>$342.63</strong></p>\n<p>And... although I'm not sure you would count this, the artisan keycaps were $200 in total for the spacebar, shift, and escape key. Although to be fair I could probably sell them right now on the second hand market for a decent markup and I bought them way before I started this build. Anyway, this came out to a pretty expensive keyboard. Totally worth it tho.</p>"},"prevPost":{"id":"5d98c2e2-dc86-5b73-9882-4a6f1125a29c","frontmatter":{"title":"Editing Las Vegas","asset_folder":1},"fields":{"year":"2019"},"html":"<p>This blog entry is a behind-the-scenes analysis of the travel video I published on Youtube a couple days ago and a hindsight look at the things I think I did well, the things that went awry, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>For reference, everything was shot on either my Yi 4K+ Action Camera or cell phone camera footage I scraped together. In total, the entire project took me about ~30 hours to complete, the first 10 of which were spent learning the ins/outs of editing in Adobe Premiere.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.258790436005626%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqQYfoxpLEE\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>I’ve always had a secret interest in film composition and going to Las Vegas to celebrate my friend’s birthday gave me an opportunity to explore it. Looking back, I wasn’t satisfied with how this video turned out. From the footage that I had shot to the specific cuts that I used, I think there was a lot of room for improvement and I certainly made a lot of mistakes putting it together.</p>\n<h3>Unplanned Shots</h3>\n<p>To be fair, I sort of went into this kind of blind. I didn’t have a specific goal or end product in mind, just that I wanted to create a video reflecting my time in Las Vegas. Because of this and the fact that I was shooting everything handheld, 90% of the footage I ended up with became unusable. Here were some of the problems I came across during my edit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Shaky Footage -</b> Because my camera was attached to a handheld grip combined with a lack of focus, most of my footage ended up really shaky. It felt like I was in mid-seizure during every shot. Even with electronic stabilization in post, the video still looked really blurry and distorted.\n<br /><br /></li>\n<li><b>Lighting -</b> I never ended up taking into account the lighting of each area I was filming in and because of this some of my footage became overexposed while others suffered from noise/graininess due to low light.\n<br /><br /></li>\n<li><b>Useless Shots -</b> I never planned any of my shots from the get-go and just filmed what I thought was interesting at the time. This ended up hurting me during the edit as I hadn’t captured any of the important moments I wanted to and the ones that did make it in had bad angles and made for rough transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Honestly, most of the trouble I ran into could’ve been fixed if I had just planned my shots! Planning in advance would’ve allowed me to think about the moments I wanted to highlight, the lighting and angles of every shot, and with a steady hand (or a gimbal), it would’ve made for a less frustrating edit. Having a clear vision going in was definitely the biggest takeaway from this experience.</p>\n<h3>Transitions and Colors</h3>\n<p>Despite all the hiccups in post, there were definitely certain aspects of the edit that I think I did well in (for a first attempt anyway). On top of that list would be custom transitions.</p>\n<p>Piecing together the footage in my timeline, I was initially transitioning from one scene to the next with a simple cut. Although effective, it quickly became jarring to watch, especially with scenes cutting from standstill shots to ones with motion. Custom transitions like zooms, wipes, and blurs helped alleviate this problem by adding motion in between the cuts making them appear more seamless and also gave a stylistic flair to the edit. It also additionally helped detract from the inherent shakiness in the footage.</p>\n<p>Color grading was another aspect of the final cut I think I managed to do a decent job in. I initially had shot everything in a flat color profile because I had wanted the flexibility to adjust the style of the video in post, but had no sense of direction on the aesthetic I was aiming for. I ended up defaulting to the classic orange and teal look that many Hollywood movies mimic today as a baseline for my color grade. Here is an example of the changes the footage went through as I was color correcting and then color grading the flat image:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 540px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 177.77777777777777%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Color Grade\"\n        title=\"Color Grade\"\n        src=\"/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/ceaae/colorgrade.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/6e1d3/colorgrade.jpg 240w,\n/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/a3e66/colorgrade.jpg 480w,\n/static/da2072a4f98aa231371f35ac35271a35/ceaae/colorgrade.jpg 540w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>This ended up working out pretty well and although I didn’t strictly adhere to the baseline profile in other shots, the overall look managed to match the aesthetic I had in mind.</p>\n<p>Editing this video was definitely a long and arduous process, but I learned a lot from the experience that I could apply to videos I make going forward!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Final Cut\"\n        title=\"Final Cut\"\n        src=\"/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/fb816/finalcut.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/6e1d3/finalcut.jpg 240w,\n/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/a3e66/finalcut.jpg 480w,\n/static/4a748544d79ecb03f25bfce4c3335ae3/fb816/finalcut.jpg 960w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>"}},"pageContext":{"currPost":"/blog/2020/custom-gk64s-build/","prevPost":"/blog/2019/editing-las-vegas/"}}}
