Although it came fully furnished, there wasn't enough lighting in my bedroom except for a single dimly lit ceiling lamp in the center. In the daytime it was fine as the windows let in plenty of natural sunlight, but at night, it became pretty gloomy.</p>\n<p>Having a prior interest in woodworking and wanting to get more comfortable using power tools, I ended up designing and building my own lamp. Below is a detailed account/guide on how I went about the project. You can also check out the timelapse video I made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iglErh-sGJ4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>The Parts</h3>\n<p>An afternoon of scrolling through pictures of hanging lights gave me the inspiration for my initial design. I wanted to make a minimalist neutral toned ceiling lamp with pendant lights and splashes of color.</p>\n<p>For parts, I bought the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5' x 7.5\" x 3\" Poplar Board from Home Depot - $12</li>\n<li>½ Pint of Weathered Gray Wood Stain - $13</li>\n<li>Silicon Socket Pendant Lights - $30</li>\n<li>Steel Wire Suspension Cables - $10</li>\n<li>Adhesive Ceiling Hooks - $7</li>\n<li>LED Dimmable Globe Bulbs - $30</li>\n<li>12-Gauge Solid Black Wire - $11</li>\n<li>Plug-In Lamp Dimmer - $13</li>\n<li>12 Feet Extension Cord - $5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choosing the right type of wood took some initial research. I wanted to buy something that was strong, stained well, and had an interesting wood grain pattern. I initially considered using Cedar, but ended up going with Poplar instead. For power tools, I had access to a woodshop where I did most of the work.</p>\n<h3>The Process</h3>\n<p>Preparing the board was fairly straightforward. I measured the Poplar and sketched drill marks at the center and then 4 more each 1’ apart. This would create a total of 5 holes for me to thread the pendant lights through with 6” leftover at the ends.</p>\n<p>I also sketched drill marks at the corners of the board to make room for the suspension cable inserts. One of the main problems I had was finding a way to hang the board on my ceiling without drilling holes into the wall. I ended up finding these thin steel wire suspension cables online made for mounting lights that I could attach to strong adhesive hooks placed on the ceiling. This proved to be the most effective way to avoid any ceiling damage and loosing my security deposit.</p>\n<p>The suspension system had to be flush with the board and it took some preliminary testing on scrap wood to find how far in from the corner of the wood I would have to drill a hole without splitting the wood. I ended up drilling 4 holes 1.5” in from the corner of the wood for the suspension system.</p>\n<h3>The Finish</h3>\n<p>Researching how to properly finish wood took most of my time. I wanted an aged rustic gray finish similar to old barn wood which would bring more focus to the colorful lights hanging beneath it. To get this look, I had to artificially age the wood. I did this by running a wire brush drill bit through the wood going slowly with and against the grain to bring out some of the texture. It was then sanded down using 220 grit paper and painted.</p>\n<p>A single coat of oil-based weathered gray wood stain applied evenly on both sides worked perfectly. After drying, I used black and white acrylic paint diluted in water to accent the wood and create contrasting color textures. For the final finish, I ended up applying wax and buffing it to create a matte finish.</p>\n<h3>The Wiring</h3>\n<p>Wiring the board up was fairly straightforward. I inserted the lights in the drilled holes and hot glued them in place. I then connected the circuit in parallel by soldering each wire to separate positive and negative terminals and used an industrial stapler to keep all the wiring in place. </p>\n<p>Initially, I was a bit concerned about overheating due to the diameter of my wire and the amount of current that would be passing through so I ended up using 12-Gauge Wire for the main lines. After testing to make sure everything was working correctly, the entire circuit was wrapped in electrical tape for insulation and with the help of some friends, hung just above the futon in my room.</p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Overall, I am pretty happy with how these lights turned out. Albeit a little bit pricey, I was definitely satisfied with the final result and learned a lot about woodworking in the process. I also documented a lot of the steps and uploaded a short timelapse video you can check out below!

EDGI is a network of scientists, professors, and other non-profits that came together in response to the Trump administration and the threat they posed to several environmental agencies and public resources. EDGI essentially took that threat as a call-to-action and since then has been working diligently as a team on developing tools and resources to help preserve environmental data.</p>\n<p>Over the summer, I became a part of that team.</p>\n<h3>Data Models</h3>\n<p>My project focused on data visualization. I was tasked with creating interactive graphs and models that would help users better visualize the data they were scraping/archiving off the internet. Using <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">D3</a>, I helped create a <strong>Coverage Map</strong> and a <strong>DataRescue Map</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Coverage Map</h4>\n<p>EDGI has been archiving data from public resources since December of last year. Previously, they had been using a tree to show coverage with each node delinating url pathing and then file structure. While this was fine at the time, as the data count went from tens to hundreds of thousands, it became <em>messy</em>. There was a disconnect between the information conveyed in the tree and what a user wanted to see.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/4/archivers.jpg\" alt=\"Archivers\"></p>\n<p>My first couple of weeks were spent prototyping different models and obtaining feedback. I went through several variations of <a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5944371\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bilevel Partitions</a>, <a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1005873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Icicle Trees</a>, and <a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063550\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">whatever this thing is</a> before finally settling on a <a href=\"https://www.datavizcatalogue.com/methods/sunburst_diagram.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sunburst Diagram</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"assets/4/sunburst.png\" alt=\"Sunburst Diagram\"></p>\n<p>Sunburst Diagrams use concentric rings with divided arcs to show groups/categories with each layer denoting hierarchy. Digging further, I found a variation on the diagram called a <a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/766f8f6d31f645c39f488a0befa1e3c8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sequence Sunburst by Kerry Rodden</a> in D3 which became a solid base to make the coverage map.</p>\n<p>After getting it to correctly convert/process a sample JSON dump of the coverage data, I started polishing the model and creating a standalone ReactJS component. There were several issues that came up during this time that slowed down progress including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Color Schemes -</strong> Initially, we used a qualitative color scheme and displayed archival rate when the user hovered over an arc. We found this to be suboptimal and instead opted into a sequential color scheme for the entire diagram.</li>\n<li><strong>Completion Rate -</strong> Each node gave us two values: <strong>numLeaves</strong> and <strong>numLeavesArchived</strong>. Archival rate was calculated using <strong>numLeavesArchived/numLeaves</strong>. Based on user feedback, the issue was whether <strong>numLeaves</strong> should be the node’s parent value or it’s own.</li>\n<li><strong>Categorizing Data -</strong> Initially, the data was separated by protocol (https, http, ftp). While this was informative, it wasn’t particularly useful. We tried to separating it by website, but that too ended up filtering out ~97% of generated sunburst sequences because they were too small to display. We eventually moved on to filetype.</li>\n<li><strong>React Integration -</strong> This was probably the most annoying one. Both D3 and ReactJS are designed in such a way that they want to directly manipulate the DOM. Ofcourse, combining them means only one can.</li>\n<li><strong>ArcTween-ing -</strong> Animating the diagram was challenging. Being new to D3, I had to figure out how to properly interpolate different arc lengths and animate the transitions between them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>DataRescue Map</h4>\n<p>While web monitoring and archiving are a large part of EDGI’s focus, the organization also hosts several <a href=\"https://envirodatagov.org/datarescue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DataRescue events</a> around the country with the goal of identifying and preserving different datasets. I always imagined it as a hackathon for archiving data.</p>\n<p>Anyway, noticing that there was no effective way to view past events, I created a projection map of the United States highlighting interactive points across the country where the events took place. It was also directly integrated with the EDGI Airtable so the map updates live as new events come up. Working on the model came with it’s fair share of obstacles as well including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Optimization -</strong> This was a big one. A lot of the coordinate calculations, polygon rendering, and JSON processing for the map is dumped on the client. Decreasing the load time for the model became an issue and a lot of the testing involved alternating between using <a href=\"https://github.com/topojson/topojson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">TopoJSON</a> and <a href=\"https://geojson.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">GeoJSON</a> data.</li>\n<li><strong>Similar Datapoints -</strong> Events held in locations &#x3C; 30 miles apart became an issue because the points were impossible to distinguish from each other on the map. A proposed solution was to aggregate nearby coordinates and increase the radius of the generated circle.</li>\n<li><strong>Screen Size -</strong> This became an issue for many people viewing across different screens/devices. Due to limitations in the Albers’ equal area-conic projection, the map couldn’t be stretched. This made it harder for mobile users in particular to see the details of individual events. Users also had a hard time noticing that the text below the projection was changing</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"currPost":"/blog/2017/diy-ceiling-lights/","prevPost":"/blog/2017/working-with-edgi/"}}}
