### Background
Eyecraft was the result of ~2 years of research under my mentor **Dr. Lucas Parra** at the **Biomedical Engineering Lab at City College**. Over the course of my junior and senior year of high school, I worked at the lab as an intern shadowing Dr. Parra and one of his graduate students who was studying Human-Computer Interaction.

At the end of my internship, I decided to conduct my own research exploring how gaming interfaces could be enhanced using eye tracking. To demonstrate my findings, I wrote a [research paper](assets/eyecraft/paper.pdf) on the topic and developed an implementation of some of the ideas I had using the [EyeTribe Tracker](https://theeyetribe.com/) and the popular sandbox game, [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).
